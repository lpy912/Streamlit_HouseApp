# Streamlit_HouseApp
Milestone 5 of the House Price Prediction Project which involve deploying the ML model in the form of web app and phone app

After creating streamlit, the web app is deployed on Heroku. You can access the web app version in the link below.

In order to make changes to the web app, we need to log in to Heroku account and do a git push so that the codes are changed in Heroku master github instead. This is simple a copy of what we have push to the Heroku github.

Next step is to change the webapp into mobile app.
