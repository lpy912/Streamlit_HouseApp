# Streamlit_HouseApp
Milestone 5 of the House Price Prediction Project which involve deploying the ML model in the form of web app and phone app

After creating streamlit, the web app is deployed on Heroku. You can access the web app version in the link below.

The reference video is posted below. It demonstrates how to deploy streamlit to Heroku with Git Bash in Windows.

In order to make changes to the web app, we need to log in to Heroku account and do a git push so that the codes are changed in Heroku master github instead. This is simply a copy of what we have push to the Heroku github.

Next step is to change the webapp into mobile app.
In order to do that, we use MIT App Inventor which has a cool function to change the web app into apk file that you can download with your Android phone (I have only tried with Android and hence do not know whether it is compatible with IOS or not).

The reference video is shown below.

Lastly, I have prepare a presentation video to recap the milestones of this project and to show how I achieve Milestone 5.
