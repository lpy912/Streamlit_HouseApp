After creating streamlit, the web app is deployed on Heroku. You can access the web app version in the link below.

The reference video is posted below. It demonstrates how to deploy streamlit to Heroku with Git Bash in Windows.

In order to make changes to the web app, we need to log in to Heroku account and do a git push so that the codes are changed in Heroku master github instead. This is simply a copy of what we have push to the Heroku github.

Next step is to change the webapp into mobile app.
In order to do that, we use MIT App Inventor which has a cool function to change the web app into apk file that you can download with your Android phone.

The reference video is shown below.
